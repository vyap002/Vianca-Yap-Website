        <p class="lead mb-4">My name’s Vianca Yap and I grew up in San Francisco but moved to Riverside for school (Although I’m temporarily back home due to Covid-19). I’m currently a second year business major at the University of California, Riverside. I’m on the pre-business path right now but I plan to concentrate on marketing in the future. I’m especially interested in food studies and plan on going abroad for culinary school after college and I’m hoping to combine my knowledge in marketing and my passion for food and travel as a career.
<br><br>

        I’ve always known what my interests were and in high school I was involved in clubs that revolved around them. I did BuildOn, which is a non profit organization that raises money to build schools in 7 different countries. I orchestrated bi-weekly bake sales to fundraise money for my plane ticket and my contribution to the cost of the school and its materials and workers. This opportunity served as a way for me to explore my interest in marketing, expand my baking skills, and participate in a cultural exchange. 
Throughout highschool and college I’ve held several jobs, mainly to have extra income, but in hindsight, they were good learning experiences for me. One of my first jobs was at Chipotle when I was 16. It was very stressful as the location I worked at was very busy but it helped me learn how to work in fast paced environments. My next job was a front desk worker at a daycare program. It made me realize that I thrive better in fast paced environments but it did help me develop interpersonal skills as I was communicating with many different kinds of people. I went back to a food industry job and worked at an ice cream shop, which I really enjoyed and since it started off as a small business with a female ceo, it really inspired me to pursue a career in business. My longest and most recent job was working at the Levi’s flagship store in San Francisco. I worked there for about a year and learned a lot about sales and marketing, as well as how to deal with customers. 
<br><br>

        Currently, I’m not working as I’m still adjusting to online school, but I’m on the lookout for marketing internships. Because I’m back in San Francisco, it’s a perfect place with so many different companies that I can work for. I’m looking for a more professional position in my field and hoping to gain more experience, whether it be in marketing or other aspects of business. Ideally, I’d like to work in a career that involves food but I’m very open to learning about new things and maybe discovering a new passion.
